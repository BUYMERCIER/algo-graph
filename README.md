# Implementations

## Graph (adjlists)

```
class Graph
```  

We have a graph **g**.  

**g.order** (the order of the graph - the number of vertices)  
**g.directed** (boolean: True if directed False if undirected)  
**g.adjlists** (a list of lists - index 0 is the list if outgoing links from 0 to the elements of the list)

## GraphMat

```
class GraphMat
```

We have a graph **g**.

**g.order** (the order of the graph - the number of vertices)  
**g.directed** (boolean: True if directed False if undirected)  
**g.adj** ()
